For this assignment, a program must be created to blink two LEDs on each of the boards with different frequencies. This was done fairly easily, using slightly diffferent code than the simple blink. The only difference between the FR6989 and G2553 were the pin and bit numbers of the LEDs. This didn't affect the code very much, it just meant that different pins would have to be enabled.
