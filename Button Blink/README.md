For this assignment, a program must be created to blink an LED on the board while a button is pressed. Again this used fairly similar code to simple blink, however new code must be added to enable the button as an input and check if it is pressed. It is also important to note that a pull-up resistor must also be enabled for the button to work properly. As for the differences between the FR and G2 boards, the only relevant difference was the pin numbers that were required for the button.
