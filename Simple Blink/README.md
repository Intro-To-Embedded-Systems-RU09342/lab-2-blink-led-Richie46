For this assignment, a program was created for both both the MSP430G2553 and MSP430FR6989 to allow one of the LEDs on the board to blink on and off while the board was powered. This was implementd for both board using very simple coding. The only difference between the MSP430G2553 and MSP430FR6989 boards was that for the MSP430FR6989, the GPIO power-on default high impedance mode had to be disabled. This has to be disabled because when enabled, the user is not able to access previously configured port settings. In other words, if this mode isn't disabled for the MSP430FR6989, the appropriate pins and bits assigned to the on-board LEDs would not be able to be utilized.
