For this assignment, we were tasked with creating a program that sould be able to use blink two LEDs at different rates using the chip on the G2, without it being conected to the board. This was very simlar to the multiple bling code, however the pins used to output to the LEDs were different because the LEDs on the board were not used. In addition to this, once the circuit was set up on a breadboard, a simple reset circuit would have to be connected to the G2 chip in order for the program to work properly.
